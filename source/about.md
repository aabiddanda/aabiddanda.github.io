Hello, I'm Arjun Biddanda

I'm a first-year PhD student at the [University of Chicago](http://www.uchicago.edu/) studying [Human Genetics](https://genes.uchicago.edu/)

My interests are in statistical and theoretical approaches to problems in [Population Genetics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_genetics)

In my free time I enjoy traveling, programming, and [cooking](https://github.com/arjunbiddanda/Recipes/blob/master/cookbook.pdf). 

For a more formal biography, you can find my CV [here]({{site.baseurl}}/arjun_biddanda_cv.pdf).
