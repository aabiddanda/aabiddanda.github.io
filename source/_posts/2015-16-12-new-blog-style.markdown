New year, new blog! I wanted to make the blog more of the primary focus since I hope to post more often now. 

Most posts will likely be shorter notes on topics that I care about, such as computer science, statistics, and genetics. The large majority will be little tips and tricks that I find useful as a computational researcher and that I hope others may find handy as well. 

Every now and again I might post on some arcane theorem that I have found useful in an unexpected way. As I progress through graduate school, I hope to write longer posts on my research projects as well.

I am using the open-source [mug theme for this blog](http://nandomoreira.me/mug/).
