### Human Statistical and Population Genetics

Much of my current work is centered on human population genetics -with a goal to understand human evolutionary history and improve experimental design for studies of human disease. A subset of my research has been developing methods for using inferred ancestral recombination graphs (ARGs) for both statistical genetics of complex traits or inference of population history. Some recent topics of interest include:

* Characterizing population history of Indian populations
* Biases in association power and considerations for meta-analysis of complex traits in realistic scenarios
* Leveraging ARGs for inference of introgression (particularly when reference samples are unavailable)
* Association mapping and quantitative genetics using inferred ARGs for complex types of variants (e.g. CNVs, SVs).


### Statistical Genetics of Chromosomal Dosage and Aneuploidy

While it is normal for most healthy individuals to contain two-copies of our genome within each cell, there can be deviations to this property either due to mutation (CNVs) or errors in chromosome segregation. A more recent research direction of mine has been to develop statistical methods for the analysis large-scale changes in chromosomal dosage (e.g. copy-number variation, or aneuploidy). Much of my research has been focused on pre-implantation genetic testing (PGT) data, which is typically quite sparse, to infer properties of aneuploidy and meiotic recombination.

Some active topics of research are:

* Inferring crossover rates within embryo PGT datasets and their genetic architecture
* Refining dosage constraint estimates of genes using embryonic segmental aneuploidy estimates
* Evolution of dosage constraints across somatic tissue evolution

### Theoretical Population Genetics

Much of my applied work draws on results from population genetic theory, and I enjoy working on problems that involve a degree of mathematical rigor or proofs. Typically, these are geared towards understanding how theory can be used to intuit or improve statistical population genetic inference. Some active topics of research in this domain are: 

* Genealogical models with time-stratified sampling
* Two-locus genealogies with spatial and temporal structure
* Inference of demographic history using time-stratified data
* Genealogical/phylogenetic models for intra-cellular/somatic evolutionary inference
