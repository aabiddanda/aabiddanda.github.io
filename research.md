### Human Statistical and Population Genetics

{% include image.html url="../images/research_images/geographic_dist.jpg" caption="Geo" height="400px" align="right" %}


Much of my current work is centered on human population genetics - particularly with to understand human evolutionary history and experimental design for studies of human disease. A subset of my research has been developing methods for using inferred ancestral recombination graphs (ARGs) for both statistical genetics of complex traits or inference of population history. Some more recent topics of interest include:

* Characterizing population history of Indian populations
* Biases in association power and considerations for meta-analysis of complex traits in realistic scenarios
* Leveraging ARGs for inference of introgression (particularly when reference samples are unavailable)
* Association mapping and quantitative genetics using inferred ARGs


### Statistical Genetics of Chromosomal Dosage and Aneuploidy

While it is normal for most healthy individuals to contain two-copies of our genome within each cell, there can be deviations to this property either due to mutation or errors in chromosome segregation. A more recent research directions has been to develop statistical methods for the analysis large-scale changes in chromosomal dosage (e.g. copy-number variation, or aneuploidy). Much of my research has been focused on pre-implantation genetic testing (PGT) data and developing methods to handle ultra-sparse data and characterize dosage constraints.

Some active topics of research are:

* Inferring crossovers within embryo PGT-A datasets and their genetic architecture
* Refining dosage constraints using embryonic segmental aneuploidies and large-scale CNV data
* Evolution of dosage constraints across somatic tissue evolution

### Theoretical Population Genetics

Much of my applied work draws on results from population genetic theory, and I enjoy working on problems that involve some degree of mathematical rigor. Typically, these are geared towards understanding how theory can be used to intuit or improve statistical population genetic inference. Some active topics of research in this domain are: 

* Genealogical models with time-stratified sampling
* Two-locus genealogies with spatial and temporal structure
* Inference of demographic history using time-stratified data
* Genealogical/phylogenetic models for intra-cellular/somatic evolutionary inference
