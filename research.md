### Population Genetic Theory

I have a fond place in my intellecual heart for population genetic theory, and enjoy working on problems that involve some degree of theoretical development and analysis. Typically, these are geared towards understanding how theory can be used to intuit or improve statistical population genetic inference. Some active topics of research are: 

* Genealogical models with time-stratified sampling
* Two-locus genealogies with spatial and temporal structure
* Inference of demographic history using time-stratified data

### Empirical Population Genetics

In the more applied population genetic setting, the increase in data availability has enabled us to learn a lot about human population history through genetics. Some active topics of research in empirical population genetics that I've undertaken have been:

* Visualizing the geographic distribution of genetic variants 
* Population history of Indian populations
* Evidence of population gene flow using ancient DNA data



### Biobank-scale Statistical Genomics

With the rapid increases in (1) sample-sizes and (2) phenotypic measurements in biobanks, there are a number of interesting statistical and computational challenges at these scales. Some active topics of research I'm thinking about in this area:

* Develop memory-efficient or streaming tools for statistical genetic analyses
* Leveraging inferred ancestral recombination graphs for statistical genetics
<!--* Machine learning methods to characterize co-occurring diseases and networks of subtypes-->
