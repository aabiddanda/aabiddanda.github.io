### Human Statistical and Population Genetics

I've had a longstanding interest in human population genetics - particularly with an angle to understanding human history and evolution.


A subset of my research in empirical population genetics has been developing methods for using inferred ancestral recombination graphs (ARGs) for both statistical genetics of complex traits or inference of population history. Some more recent topics of interest include:

* leveraging ARGs for inference of introgression
* 



### Statistical Genetics of Chromosomal Dosage and Aneuploidy

One of my more recent research directions has been to develop statistical methods for the analysis of preimplantation genetic testing (PGT) data.


Some active topics of research are:

* Inferring crossovers within embryo PGT-A datasets and their genetic architecture relative to 
* Characterizing spatial gradients of selection against aneuploidies in embryos from PGT-A data


### Theoretical Population Genetics

I have a fond place in my intellecual heart for population genetic theory, and enjoy working on problems that involve some degree of mathematical rigor. Typically, these are geared towards understanding how theory can be used to intuit or improve statistical population genetic inference. Some active topics of research I'm working on in this domain are: 

* Genealogical models with time-stratified sampling
* Two-locus genealogies with spatial and temporal structure
* Inference of demographic history using time-stratified data
* Leveraging genealogical models for intra-cellular processes 

### Empirical Population Genetics

In the more applied population genetic setting, the increase in data availability has enabled us to learn a lot about human population history through genetics. Some active topics of research in empirical population genetics are:

* Visualizing the geographic distribution of genetic variants 
* Demographic history of Indian populations
* Evidence of population gene flow using ancient DNA data

### Biobank-scale Statistical Genomics

With the rapid increases in (1) sample-sizes and (2) phenotypic measurements in biobanks, there are a number of interesting statistical and computational challenges at these scales. Some active topics of research I'm thinking about in this area:

* Develop memory-efficient or streaming tools for statistical genetic analyses
* Leveraging inferred ancestral recombination graphs for statistical genetics
