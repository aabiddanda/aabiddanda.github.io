<!-- TODO: need to align this along relevant themes -->
<!-- My research interests span both theoretical and applied population genetics - particularly within humans. Much of this research is motivated by both the increasing availibility of diverse genomic data types (e.g. ancient DNA) and studies of complex traits. Some recent topics of interest have been:
	
* The demographic history of isolated populations
* The spatial distribution of variants shared between ancient and modern samples
* Multi-locus models of genetic variation with serial sampling
* Statistical genetic methods for biobank-scale data -->

### Population Genetic Theory

I have a fond place in my intellecual heart for population genetic theory, and enjoy working on problems that involve some degree of theoretical development and analysis. Typically, these are geared towards understanding how theory can be used to intuit or improve statistical population genetic inference. Some active topics of research interests involve: 

* Genealogical models with time-stratified sampling
* Two-locus genealogies with spatial and temporal structure
* Inference of demographic history using time-stratified data

### Empirical Population Genetics

In the more applied population genetic setting, the increase in data availability has enabled us to learn more about human population history through genetics. I am particularly interested in the population genetic history in India and its relevance to local disease burden. I am also interested in the relationship between genetic ancestry and culture within the region.

### Biobank-scale Statistical Genomics

With the rapid increases in (1) sample-sizes and (2) phenotypic measurements in biobanks, there are a number of interesting statistical and computational challenges arising from the scale of this data. Some active topics of research, I'm working on in this area are:

* Develop memory-efficient or streaming tools for statistical genetic analyses
* Leveraging ancestral recombination graphs in statistical genetics
* Machine learning methods to characterize co-occurring diseases and subtypes
