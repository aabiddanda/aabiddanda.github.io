I am a PhD student in [Human Genetics](https://genes.uchicago.edu/) at the [University of Chicago](http://www.uchicago.edu/) working with [John Novembre](https://jnpopgen.org). I recieved my BSc in Computer Science from [Cornell University](http://www.cornell.edu/) in 2015. 


My research interests are in theoretical and applied [population genetics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_genetics), particularly in humans. I'm interested in developing statistical and computational methods to investigate the evolutionary forces that have shaped human genotypic and phenotypic variation. Its an extremely exciting time to be working in this field due to the explosion of genomic data that is now available. 


When not thinking about population genetic problems I enjoy traveling, playing table-tennis, and [cooking](https://github.com/arjunbiddanda/Recipes).
