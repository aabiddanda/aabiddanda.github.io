I am a PhD student at the [University of Chicago](http://www.uchicago.edu/) in the department of [Human Genetics](https://genes.uchicago.edu/). My research interests lie primarily in the fields of statistical and [population genetics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_genetics). 

Prior to the University of Chicago, I recieved my BSc from [Cornell University](http://www.cornell.edu/) in Computer Science.

In my free time I enjoy traveling, playing ping-pong, and [cooking](https://github.com/arjunbiddanda/Recipes/blob/master/cookbook.pdf).
