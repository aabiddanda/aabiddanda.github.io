I am currently a PhD student in [Human Genetics](https://genes.uchicago.edu/) at the [University of Chicago](http://www.uchicago.edu/) advised by [John Novembre](https://jnpopgen.org).

Previous to the University of Chicago, I spent 4 wonderful years at [Cornell University](http://www.cornell.edu/) and graduated with a degree in Computer Science in 2015. While at Cornell I was incredibly fortunate to work with [Alon Keinan](http://keinanlab.cb.bscb.cornell.edu) and [Amy Williams](http://williamslab.bscb.cornell.edu). 

My research interests are in theoretical and applied [population genetics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_genetics), particularly in humans. I'm interested in developing statistical and computational methods to investigate the evolutionary forces that have shaped human genotypic and phenotypic variation.

When not thinking about population genetic problems I enjoy traveling, playing table-tennis, and [cooking](https://github.com/arjunbiddanda/Recipes/cooking.pdf).
