# The Site-Frequency Spectrum (SFS)

The Site-Frequency Spectrum (SFS) is a population genetics term (albeit a very important one) that refers to a histogram. The x-axis of the histogram refers to the number of times that an allele is present in the sample (allele count), and the y-axis is simply the frequency of those counts.

## Further Thoughts

I initially used this as an excuse to become more familiar with the `msprime` coalescent simulator, but it has proved to be a lot more engaging than just learning a framework.
