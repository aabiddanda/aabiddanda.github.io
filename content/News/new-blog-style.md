New year, new blog! I wanted to make the blog more of the primary focus since I hope to post more often now. Previously I had hosted this blog using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) as a static site generator, but it always caused me a little anxiety that it was written in Ruby and I am not quite as proficient in Ruby. A couple of months ago I stumbled upon a static site generator called [Pelican](http://blog.getpelican.com) and it was written in Python. I know Python much better than Ruby and thus I moved the blog to use Pelican and the [Flex](https://github.com/alexandrevicenzi/Flex) theme by [Alexandre Vicenzi](https://www.alexandrevicenzi.com).

A lot of the posts in this blog will be short tips and tricks for hacking on the command line and other data analysis tips. Some subset of posts will be about some piece of mathematical or population genetic theory that I have found interesting. 

As I progress through graduate school, I hope to write more involved posts on my research projects as well. These posts will generally center around computational genetics and serve to highlight either new results that I have gotten or a new method that I have been working on.
