This is the landing page for the [McCoy Lab's](https://mccoy-lab.org/) Half-Day Scientific Retreat! 

The primary goals of this short retreat are to:

1.  Provide a broader overview of our scientific interests to each other at a high level. 
2.  Learn something new about scientific communication to improve our own scientific talks.  
3.  Deepen our collective appreciation for the iconic early 2000s (and exceptionally meme-able) anime series [Yu-Gi-Oh](https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Yu-Gi-Oh!_Wiki) [^0] 

Since we'll likely be doing some things during the retreat that might feel difficult or out of our comfort zones, *the only groundrule is the same as in the lab:* **maintain the utmost respect for your colleagues** [^1]

To quote the King of Games: ["This lab has no pathetic members, Kaiba"](https://youtu.be/hVoUh1y6dI4?t=6){:target="_blank"}, so lets maintain that ethos [^2] 

If you have any questions/comments/concerns/vibes please contact Arjun via slack or [email](mailto:abiddan1@jhu.edu).

# Schedule (10/17/23) {#schedule}

Given the shorter timeframe for the retreat - we've tried to organize it to be (1) highly focused and (2) limited in the amount of preparation required. We highly recommend getting your caffiene prior to arriving at FastForward U.

# Activity 1: Research Lightning Talks {#activity1}

Each member will give a 5 minute (timed) lightning talk on their research/questions-of-interest as a broad overview. 

Some things that you should **not** do are:

* Go into depth on a specific project
* Show slides dealing with actual data (conceptual figures are fine here)

The larger point here is to have some protected time where we can zoom out from the research "tunnel-vision" a bit.

# Activity 2: Communicating Science with Jean-Luc Dumont {#activity2}

Being able to give a talk is fairly critical to a lot of career paths. However, giving a talk and giving a *good* talk are two different things. In many of our trainings' we rarely get feedback on the actual action of speaking and the delivery of information to a variety of audiences. This abbreviated activity is based on [previous work by my colleague, with full attribution](https://github.com/dp-rice/dp-rice.github.io/blob/master/pdf/PresentationSkillsForGraduateStudents.pdf) [Dan Rice](dp-rice.github.io)[^5]. 

We will be collectively watching and discussing the following two clips from Jean-Luc:

* [Introducing yourself and your work
](https://www.youtube.com/watch?start=660&end=1040&v=IFu3jaLmse0&feature=youtu.be)
* [The problems of distance, attention getters, adapting to your audience
](https://www.youtube.com/watch?start=1040&end=1290&v=IFu3jaLmse0&feature=youtu.be)

When listening to these clips try to keep the following in mind:

1. An idea you plan to focus on in your talk - specifically as it pertains to either clip
2. An idea you disagreed with from Doumont
3. Observations about Doumont’s own organization and delivery 

After the clips, we will share with the group and keep a list of (1) in a visible place in the classroom.

# Activity 3: "PaperJam" + Public Speaking Practice  {#activity3}

There are two main goals for this activity: (1) to practice aspects of giving talks that are less content focused but on the actual aspect of speaking and (2) to provide some readings + context for a scientific idea. 

The guidelines for the "PaperJam"[^3] are as follows: 

### 1. Find a series of 3 papers with the following qualities: 

* The first must be published before 1990
* The second should be published between 1990 - 2020
* The third must be published between 2020 - present

*NOTE: you're not limited to genetics! If you have interests outside of genetics/genomics that meet the criteria above and you could talk about that is highly encouraged.*

<!-- There might be some common reactions to the task above:  -->

<!-- *Why?* Science is overall a kind of [Sisyphisian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sisyphus) task of building on previous work and contextualizing it with new data/techniques, with more questions arising and knocking you back down the hill to tackle it again. Modern day genomics is no different, just the [deluge of scientific papers](https://www.nature.com/nature-index/news/the-growth-of-papers-is-crowding-out-old-classics) has increased, and the daily grind of science is focused on knowledge typically from the past ~5 years or so (incidentally the [timeframe for a lot of R01 grants](https://blog.eoscu.com/blog/why-are-r01-nih-grants-such-a-big-deal#:~:text=The%20R01%20Grant&text=Funding%20for%20this%20grant%20category,years%20and%20can%20be%20renewed.)). By taking a slightly longer term view than we might normally, we hopefully can get more of an understanding of how a specific sub-area might have changed. 

*But what about data?* Its easy to forget that folks had predictions of phenomena prior to data that we take for granted today (e.g. Neutral Evolution, the Higgs-Boson, etc). Understanding the logic for these previous predictions is often kind of critical to how we might re-interpret data today. 

*This is annoying - not everyone likes papers from before 1990!* You're in luck, those first papers will [almost certainly be shorter and easier to read than more recent ones](https://elifesciences.org/articles/27725), so you actually have much less work than you thought!  --> 

### 2. Give a 5 minute no-slides presentation about the theme of the three papers

The focus of the presentation here is to help practice your skills for delivering talks. **The audience of this is meant to be a general audience!**. One active thing that you can do is at the beginning of your presentation is state what you are aiming to emphasize in particular.

### 3. Feedback on oral presentation skills from colleagues

Given the timeframe, we'll spend ~2 minutes giving feedback to the speaker on ideas that they used well from Jean-Luc's videos and potential areas where they could improve. While listening to presentations, each leaner writes at least one “don’t change” and one “maybe rethink” aspect of the talk. 

After each speaker, there will be around ~2 minutes for oral feedback from peers and instructors. You're encouraged to couch your feedback positively and sensitively[^6]. At the end of the workshop, each speaker receives all of the feedback cards for their talk.

## [Optional] Lunch Discussion 

As an optional lunch discussion (pending interest), we can go over the points made in David Stern's excellent post ["How to give a talk"](https://www.howtogiveatalk.com/). If you are interested, simply read the post and come to lunch with your favorite bit of advice from that
