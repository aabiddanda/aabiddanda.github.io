## Preparation / Pre-Requisites

Given the shorter timeframe for the retreat - we've tried to organize it to be (1) highly focused and (2) limited amount of preparation. So what we've tried to do is

## Activity 1: XXX

*

## Activity 2: "PaperJam" + Practicing Public Speaking 

There are two main goals for this activity: (1) to practice aspects of giving talks that are not about the material per-say and (2) to provide some readings + context for a scientific idea. 

The guidelines for the "PaperJam"[^1] are as follows: 

#### 1. Find a series of 3 papers with the following qualities: 

* The first must be published before 1990
* The second should be published between 1990 - 2020
* The third must be published between 2020 - present


There might be some common reactions to the task above: 

*Why?* Science is overall a kind of [Sisyphisian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sisyphus) task of building on previous work and contextualizing it with new data/techniques, with more questions arising and knocking you back down the hill to tackle it again. Modern day genomics is no different, just the [deluge of scientific papers](https://www.nature.com/nature-index/news/the-growth-of-papers-is-crowding-out-old-classics) has increased, and the daily grind of science is focused on knowledge typically from the past ~5 years or so (anecdotally the [timeframe for a lot of R01 grants](https://blog.eoscu.com/blog/why-are-r01-nih-grants-such-a-big-deal#:~:text=The%20R01%20Grant&text=Funding%20for%20this%20grant%20category,years%20and%20can%20be%20renewed.)). By taking a slightly longer term view than we might normally, we hopefully can get more of an understanding of how a specific sub-area might have changed.  

*But what about data?* Its easy to forget that folks had predictions of phenomena prior to data that we take for granted today (e.g. Neutral evolution, the Higgs-Boson, etc). Understanding the logic for these previous predictions is often kind of critical to how we might re-interpret data today. 

*This is annoying - not everyone likes papers from before 1990!* You're in luck, those first papers will [almost certainly be shorter and easier to read than more recent ones](https://elifesciences.org/articles/27725), so you actually have much less work than you thought!  


#### 2. Give a 5 minute presentation about the three papers 


TODO .... 
 


#### 3. Feedback on oral presentation skills from colleagues

This is the toughest task overall (both for the speaker and colleagues).

A rubric for providing feedback on the qualities of public speaking can be found [here](XXX).
