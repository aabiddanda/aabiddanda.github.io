    <p>I am a PhD student in <a href="https://genes.uchicago.edu/">Human Genetics</a> at the <a href="http://www.uchicago.edu/">University of Chicago</a> advised by <a href="http://jnpopgen.org/">John Novembre</a>.
    My research interests are in theoretical and applied <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_genetics">population genetics</a>, particularly in humans. My primary interests are in developing statistical and computational methods to investigate the evolutionary forces that have shaped human genetic and phenotypic variation.</p>
