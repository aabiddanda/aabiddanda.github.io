    <p>I am a second-year PhD student in <a href="https://genes.uchicago.edu/">Human Genetics</a> at the <a href="http://www.uchicago.edu/">University of Chicago</a> advised by <a href="https://jnpopgen.org">John Novembre</a>.
    
    Prior to the University of Chicago, I spent 4 wonderful years at <a href="http://www.cornell.edu/">Cornell University</a> and graduated with a degree in Computer Science in 2015. While at Cornell I was incredibly fortunate to work with <a href="http://keinanlab.cb.bscb.cornell.edu">Alon Keinan</a> and <a href="http://williamslab.bscb.cornell.edu">Amy Williams</a>. </p>
    
		<p>My research interests are in theoretical and applied <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_genetics">population genetics</a>, particularly in humans. My primary interests are in developing statistical and computational methods to investigate the evolutionary forces that have shaped human genetic and phenotypic variation.</p>
