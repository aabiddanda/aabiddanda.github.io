I am currently a PhD student in the department of [Human Genetics](https://genes.uchicago.edu/) at the University of Chicago and am advised by [John Novembre](http://jnpopgen.org/). Prior to the University of Chicago, I spent 4 wonderful years at Cornell University and worked with [Alon Keinan](http://keinanlab.cb.bscb.cornell.edu/) while learning the fundamentals of population genetics.

My research interests span both theoretical and applied population genetics - particularly within humans and its influence on complex phenotypes. Some recent topics of interest have been in the demographic history of isolated populations, the geographic distribution of functional alleles, and the spatial distribution of variants shared between ancient and modern samples.
