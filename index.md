I am a scientist at [54gene](https://54gene.com/) working in the Genomics and Data Science group. 

My research interests span theoretical and applied population genetics, particularly in humans and their applications to understanding complex disease. I received my PhD in Human Genetics from the University of Chicago working with [John Novembre](http://jnpopgen.org/), and was a postdoctoral researcher in statistics at Oxford advised by [Pier Palamara](https://palamaralab.github.io).
