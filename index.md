My research spans both theoretical and applied population genetics, utilizing a combination of mathematical, computational, and empirical approaches. I recieved my PhD in Human Genetics from the University of Chicago, supervised by John Novembre. 

I am currently a Postdoctoral Researcher in the department of [Statistics](https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/) at the University of Oxford and am advised by [Pier Palamara](https://palamaralab.github.io/).
