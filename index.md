I am a postdoctoral fellow at [Johns Hopkins University](https://bio.jhu.edu/),  advised by [Rajiv McCoy](https://mccoy-lab.org/). 

My research interests span theoretical and applied population genetics, particularly to understand human disease and evolution. I received my PhD in Human Genetics from the University of Chicago working with [John Novembre](http://jnpopgen.org/), and was previously a postdoctoral researcher at Oxford advised by [Pier Palamara](https://palamaralab.github.io).
