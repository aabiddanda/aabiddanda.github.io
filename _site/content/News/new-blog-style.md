New year, new blog! I wanted to make the blog more of the primary focus since I hope to post more often now. Previously I had hosted this blog using [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) as a static site generator, but it always caused me a little anxiety that it was written in Ruby and I am not quite proficient in Ruby (yet). A couple of months ago I stumbled upon a static site generator called [Pelican](http://blog.getpelican.com) and it was written in Python! I know Python much better and thus I moved blog to use Pelican and the [Flex](https://github.com/alexandrevicenzi/Flex) theme by [Alexandre Vicenzi](https://www.alexandrevicenzi.com).

A lot of the posts in the blog will likely be shorter tips and tricks for hacking on the command line and doing small things that I have found useful. Some subset of posts may be about some piece of mathematical or population genetic theory that I have found interesting and maybe a couple of interesting results. 

As I progress through graduate school, I hope to write more involved posts on my research projects as well. These posts will generally center around computational genetics and serve to highlight either new results that I have gotten or a new method that I have been working on.
