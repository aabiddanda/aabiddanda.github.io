###  [geovar](https://aabiddanda.github.io/geovar/)

`GeoVar` is a software tool for coarse-grained visualization of multi-population patterns of allele sharing in `python`. If you use this package please cite [this paper](https://elifesciences.org/articles/60107)

### [qtl-power](https://aabiddanda.github.io/qtl-power/)

`qtl-power` is a python package that allows for easy calculation and plotting of power for genome-wide association studies (GWAS) under a number of experimental settings. Some features of this package are currently more experimental (e.g. burden-testing power estimation).

### [Olink QC Pipeline](https://54gene-olink-qc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

A small workflow I wrote while in industry to support automated QC of Olink targetted proteomics data for downstream applications. 

### [haplotype-phasing](https://github.com/aabiddanda/haplotype-phasing)

A workflow for performing reference-based (and within sample) haplotype phasing using pre-existing software as a prior step to imputation.

### [arjun_plot](https://github.com/aabiddanda/arjun_plot)

A collection of plotting utilities and functions for [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/stable/) that I have accrued over the years. Most of the routines are inspired by having to remake plots for publication or common plots useful in statistical genetics.
