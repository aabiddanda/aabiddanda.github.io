I've always enjoyed art galleries and museums for their tranquility, and their actually great places to get some valuable "thinking time". I also think like a lot of people I don't really have a strong eye for art.

I was intrigued by the [Kandinsky package](http://giorasimchoni.com/2017/07/30/2017-07-30-data-paintings-the-kandinsky-package/) and its ability to create algorithmically driven art. Its certainly less sophisticated that currently derived machine-learning methods (like variational autoencoders, for example). The downside is that it only generates art in the style of Kandinsky, rather than mimicing the stylings of another artist.
