## Notes & Miscellanea

This is a space for technical notes or other collections on various topics that I have found helpful for understanding population or human genetics but are not either super-novel or not extensive enough that they are worthy of a full paper (or stalled projects that deserve a home). 

### [Moran Model deviations under large sample-size](https://github.com/aabiddanda/Cannings_Model_Approximations/blob/master/pdf/derivation.pdf)

One of my first mini-projects in grad school was looking at how the Moran model behaves under large sample sizes relative to the population size. It was a really fun way to get some theoretical insight into the coalescent process and the limiting behavior of discrete models. If interested in the code to reproduce any of the figures, you can find the code here in this [repository](https://github.com/aabiddanda/Cannings_Model_Approximations). This work was heavily inspired by the work of [Bhaskar, Clark, and Song](https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.1322709111) as I was starting my PhD. 

### [Reading Group Reflections on Genetics & Race](https://voices.uchicago.edu/geneticists-against-hate/)

This was a reading group held at UChicago in the Summer of 2020 that focused on the intersection on genetics and race. It also contains a useful set of resources for running your own groups on these topics if you're interested. On a personal note, this reading group was exceptionally beneficial to my graduate school education and I would recommend some form of this training for aspiring human and evolutionary geneticists.
