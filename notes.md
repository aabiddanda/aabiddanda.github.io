This is a space for technical notes or other collections on various topics that I have found helpful for understanding population or human genetics but are not either super-novel or not extensive enough that they are worthy of a full paper (or stalled projects that deserve a home). 

<!-- ### Population Genetics -->

<!-- * Deviations of the Moran Model from the Coalescent under large sample-size -->
  <!-- [Paper]() [Code]() -->

## Genetics & Society
### [Reading Group Reflections on Genetics & Race](https://voices.uchicago.edu/geneticists-against-hate/)

This was a reading group held at UChicago in the Summer of 2020 that focused on the intersection on genetics and race. It also contains a useful set of resources for running your own groups on these topics if you're interested. On a personal note, this reading group was exceptionally beneficial to my graduate school education and I would recommend some form of this training for aspiring human and evolutionary geneticists.
