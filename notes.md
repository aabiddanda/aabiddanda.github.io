This is a space for technical notes or other collections on various topics that I have found helpful for understanding population or human genetics but are not necessarily expansive enough for full-fledged papers (or stalled projects that deserve a home).

### Population Genetics

* Deviations of the Moran Model from the Coalescent under large sample-size
  [Paper]() [Code]()

### Genetics & Society

* [Reading Group Reflections on Genetics & Race](https://voices.uchicago.edu/geneticists-against-hate/)

This was a reading group held at UChicago in the Summer of 2020
