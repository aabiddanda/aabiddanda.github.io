I am a PhD student at the [University of Chicago](http://www.uchicago.edu/) in the department of [Human Genetics](https://genes.uchicago.edu/). My research interests lie primarily in the fields of statistical and [population genetics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_genetics). Prior to the University of Chicago, I recieved my BSc from [Cornell University](http://www.cornell.edu/) in Computer Science, working with [Dr. Alon Keinan](http://keinanlab.cb.bscb.cornell.edu/content/people) and [Dr. Amy Williams](http://williamslab.bscb.cornell.edu/).

In my free time I enjoy traveling, playing ping-pong, and [cooking](https://github.com/arjunbiddanda/Recipes/blob/master/cookbook.pdf). 

For a more formal (boring) biography, you can find my CV [here]({{site.baseurl}}/arjun_biddanda_cv2015.pdf).
