# My Blog 

I have always been attracted to keep a blog because I have gained a lot of insight into a variety of topics by reading other blogs. Its also a good excuse to practice my writing and a way to convey thoughts in a short and (hopefully) digestible manner. The topics covered here will be various things that I have found interesting ranging from statistical and human genetics (my research area) to number theory and probability (some interests of mine). 

This comes with the disclaimer that anything relatively technical posted here is not meant to be for any sort of pedagogy (or quite frankly to be of use to anyone else), but will be most likely in a vague and unclarified format. Many of the posts will likely involve things that I have thought about over the course of my research but realized are best explained in a small blog post and not a full fledged research project.
